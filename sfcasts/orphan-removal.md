# Orphan Removal

When we used `make:entity` to add a relation, it asked us about
`orphanRemoval`. Time to find out what that is & when to use it.

In the fixtures, start with `$starshipPart = StarshipPartFactory::createOne()`.
To make it stand out, I'll make this a *crucial* item for any space voyage:
"Toilet Paper." Yes, a cheeky nod to pandemic times. Yuck!

Assign this part to the `Starship` above (add the missing `$ship =`)
then dump `$starshipPart`:

[[[ code('001d4573f7') ]]]

So far, so good: nothing fancy. Try reloading the fixtures:

```terminal-silent
symfony console doctrine:fixtures:load
```
No errors, and for the first time, we see that proxy object I've been mentioning.

## Unveiling the Proxy Object

Remember: when you create an object via Foundry, it hands you back your shiny new
object, but it's bundled up inside *another* object called a proxy.
Most of the time: you don't notice or care: all method calls on the proxy
are *forwarded* to the real object.

But because I want to make things crystal clear, extract the real object from both
`$ship` and `$starshipPart` using `_real()`:

[[[ code('722d63280c') ]]]

Run the fixtures again:

```terminal-silent
symfony console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

And... all smooth. Without the proxy, we can see that the `StarshipPart` is
*indeed* tied to the correct `Starship` - the USS Espresso â€” which we created
earlier. So far, it's all systems go!

## Deleting a Starship Part: The Plot Thickens

But what if we need to delete a `StarshipPart`? Normally, 
we'd say `$manager->remove($starshipPart)`, then `$manager->flush()`. But let's
mix things up: let's simply *remove* the part from its ship:
`$ship->removePart($starshipPart)`:

[[[ code('fe77652c62') ]]]

What do you think will happen? Will it delete the part? Or just remove it from
the ship? In that case, the part will just be floating around in space,
it'll become an orphan. Try it:

```terminal-silent
symfony console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

It blows up with our favorite:

> `starship_id` cannot be null. 

## Fixing the Null Error

Why did this happen? When we call `removePart()`, it sets the `Starship` to
null. *But* we made that not allowed with `nullable: false`: every
part *must* belong to a ship. The solution? Well, it depends on what you want:
do we want to allow parts to become orphaned? Cool! Change `nullable` to true
in `StarshipPart` and make a migration.

Or maybe if a part is suddenly removed from its ship, we want to delete
that part entirely from the database. Maybe the ship owner isn't a big fan of
recycling. To do *this*, head to `Starship` and add `orphanRemoval: true`
to the `OneToMany`:

[[[ code('3e1585083f') ]]]

Whirl back and reload the fixtures:

```terminal-silent
symfony console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

No errors in sight! The ID is null because it was entirely deleted
from the database. So `orphanRemoval` means:

> Hey, if any of these parts become orphaned toss them into the
> incinerator.

Next up: we'll explore a way to control the *order* of a relation,
like making `$ship->getParts()` return alphabetically.
